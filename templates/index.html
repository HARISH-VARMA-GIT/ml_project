        <h2>About the Predictor</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Credit Risk Predictor, a tool designed to assess creditworthiness and help you understand your credit risk.
            Credit risk refers to the likelihood that an individual or organization will repay loan or credit card bills.
            A "Good" credit risk score indicates that the person is likely to repay loans or bills.Wheras "Bad" credit risk score indicates that the person is not likely to repay loans or bills

        </p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> You begin by entering key financial information, such as your payment history, income, and other relevant details, into the predictor.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> The predictor processes this data and extracts essential features that contribute to your creditworthiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong> The extracted features are then fed into a sophisticated machine learning model, which has been trained on a vast dataset of credit histories.</li>
            <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The model analyzes the patterns within the data to understand how specific factors relate to credit risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Risk Score:</strong> Based on the analysis, the predictor generates a personalized credit risk score that categorizes your creditworthiness as either "Good" or "Bad."</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
